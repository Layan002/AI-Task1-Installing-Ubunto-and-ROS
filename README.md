# Installing ROS1
1- To install ROS1, Open your Ubunto OS in the Virtual Machine, then follow the description in [this page](https://wiki.ros.org/noetic/Installation/Ubuntu) carefully. DONT just copy paste the commands on the terminal shell. In addition, I strongly recommend you to use ChatGPT if you encountered any problem.<br> 
2- commands extra explination from me:<br>
- Before installing any peckage of Debian-based Linux distributions (such as Ubuntu). These commands are so important since they manage software packages and to keep your system up-to-date and avoid many errors and problems you may encounter, use the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade
```
